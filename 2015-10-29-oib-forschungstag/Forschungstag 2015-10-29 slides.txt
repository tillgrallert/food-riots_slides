# background

- gap in scholarly literature / attention: the phenomenon of contentious collective action in the Middle East has not received systematic attention
- very few, generalising and evidently false claims as to the nature and history of contentious collection action in *bilād al-shām*
- contrary to common arguments and presumptions, we find a long "tradition" of popular contentions in general and food "riots" in particular as well as female agency in genuinely political struggles in public places / space  

# main claims / arguments

- food riots are part of a "repertoire of contention" (C. Tilly)
- food riots cannot be considered as "the spontaneous erruption of popular anger" 
- they must be considered a *tactic* choice on behalf of the protestors and an inherently political act.
- the target of this conscious political *tactic* are the ruling authorities; protestors call for *equitable distribution* and *fair access* to *available bread*.
- food riots are thus part of the negotiations over political legitimacy *within* the existing political order as based in *just rule*, *safety of life*, etc. 
- food riots are an inherently *urban phenomenon*; foodstuffs are only accessible through some commodity exchange (market)

# main questions

- are food riots a contentious repertoir?
- what are the components (participants, demands, locations, occasions) of this repertoire and how do they change?
- what is the function / purpose of the demonstrators' *tactic* decisions---lower bread prices, political change?
- what is the relation between food prices and food riots?
- why do we encounter geographic clustering?


# Sources 1: newspapers

available at libraries in Lebanon, Jordan, Israel/ Palestine, Istanbul, increasingly as digital image files

+ value: detailed and dated information on events and prices
+ problem: yet unknown extent of censorship during WWI, holdings of other than the most important papers from Beirut and Damascus still need to be established

# Sources 2: official records

more or less easily accessible, mostly on site in the respective state archives

+ PA AA
    * value: easily available, source from within the Ottoman armed forces, Fritz Grobba was Etappeninspekteur of the IV Army
+ BOA
    * value: official records of the main party in the war, the local authorities on the ground
    * problem: my limited knowledge of Ottoman, context of individual files unclear, 
+ NACP
    * value: detailed accounts of economic developments, local consular archives did survive, local consular agents, US entered the war only in 1917
+ PRO (TNA) FO
    * problems: British and French consulates were closed with the outbreak of hostilities, professional / career diplomats, local consular archives were seized by Ottoman Empire
    * value: military intelligence 

# Sources 3: ego documents

available in large numbers as (gray) editions

+ value: detailed information on contexts and the experience of war, famine, hunger
+ problem: almost no dated, detailed information on collective action (beyond the war effort), focus on Cemal Pasha as the impersonated devil (i.e. *al-Saffāḥ*)

# Secondary literature 1: WWI

**most important finding**: scholars stick to very strict periodizations. Historians of WWI have frequently no or very limited knowledge of anything prior to 1914 or after 1918; e.g. Talha Çiçek, Zachary Foster, Aaron Tylor Brand (who also has very little data), Melanie Tanielian

- on the war itself (battles, movement of troops, political event history)
    + Talha Çiçek
- on the famine: 
    + Melanie Tanielian, Aaron Brand, al-Qattan, Linda Schatkowski-Schilcher, Birgit Schäbler
- focus on ego documents: 
    + Selim Deringil, Seven Ağır, Malek Sharif, Najwa al-Qattan, Zachary Foster, Salim Tamari, Talha Çiçek, Alia El Bakri, BTS 99, Khairiah Kasmieh, Geoffrey Lewis


# Secondary literature 2: theoretical background

+ collective action
+ repertoir of contentions
+ weapons of the weak

# Practical questions: when and where did food riots take place?

# Practical questions: retrieve bread prices

How can we reliably retrieve information on bread prices etc. from a body of 15.000 + sources? Mark-up!

~~~{.xml}
<measureGrp>
    <measure commodity="wheat" unit="kile" quantity="1">a kile of wheat</measure> is currently sold for
    <measure commodity="currency" unit="ops" quantity="48">48 piaster in gold</measure>
</measureGrp>
~~~

# Practical questions: plot the prices over time

The normalised mark-up is used in conjunction with an XML database such as eXistDB, which can then be queried for all prices of a specifiec commodity using XQuery.

- [live-query of wheat prices](http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/BachSources/xquery/measures.xql?commodity=wheat) 

The prices can then be fed into a visualisation library such as a SIMILE:

- [live-view of all marked-up wheat prices in Damascus](file:///BachUni/projekte/XML/SIMILE%20Timeplot/timeplotExistDB.html)
- [pre-computed prices of wheat in Damascus](file:///BachUni/projekte/XML/SIMILE%20Timeplot/timeplotGrainPricesDamascus.html)
