    3. research questions
2. Developing hypotheses against the backdrop of this week's reading(s) (you/us)
3. Analysis of the food riots. Testing some hypotheses against the historical data (me)
4. Discussion (us)

# 1.2 First observations

- there is no or at least no immediate looting
- the crowds address the political authorities, predominantly peacefully
- the crowds gather at central places, i.e. on the streets and in front of the seat of the political authorities
- women are a (substantial) part of the protests

# 1.3 Research questions

- Primary questions:
    - What is the function/purpose of food riots---lower bread prices, political change?
    - What is the relevance of food riots for our established "knowledge" of urban societies in the Eastern Mediterranean?
- Secondary questions:
    - Are food riots (part of) a "repertoire of contention?
    - What are the components (participants, demands, locations, occasions) of this repertoire and how do they change?
    - What is the relation between food prices and food riots?
    - Why do we encounter geographic clustering?

# 2. Hypotheses

Let's hypothesize and discuss Louise Tilly's article in relation to what we just heard! 

# 2. Hypotheses

1. There is no direct causal relation between food prices and food riots
2. Food riots are a *tactic* choice on behalf of the protestors and an inherently political act 
3. Food riots are part of a relatively stable "repertoire of contention" (C. Tilly) and a symbolic repertoire
4. The target of this conscious political *tactic* are the ruling authorities; protestors call for *equitable distribution* and *fair access* to *available bread*.
5. Food riots are thus part of the negotiations over political legitimacy *within* the existing political order as based in *just rule*, *safety of life*, etc. The demands are conservative and principally recognised as legitimate

# 3. Analysis

# 3.1 Methodology

- Capture and analysis of economic data on food prices
- Detailed case studies to individual food riots
- Systematic analysis of all food riots as part of a "repertoire of contention"

# 3.2 Sources

- Local newspapers and periodicals
- Consular reports
- Ottoman archival documents
- First person accounts

# 3.3 First results

Sample of 10 food riots between 1875 and 1920 in Aleppo, Beirut, Damascus, Hama, Homs and Jaffa ([Map](../assets/food-riots/Map-FoodRiots.html), [table](../assets/food-riots/Table-FoodRiots.html))

1. There is no direct causal relation between food riots and food prices ([graph](../assets/food-riots/timeplotGrainPricesDamascus.html))
2. Food riots are a relatively stable "repertoire of contention"

# 3.3.1 Repertoire of contention: prologue

1. Artificially high prices
2. Advantageous moment

# 3.3.2 Repertoire of contention: the food "riot"

3. A crowd of poor people---men, women and children---gathers
4. The crowd marches onto the seat of the local government and peacefully raises its demand for affordable bread and grain
5. The crowd is violently dispersed / a combination of promises and threats leads the crowd to dissolve. Original failure of the authorities leads to further escalation.
6. (optional) The crowds turns on merchants and loots warehouses, stores, and railway stations
7. Successful intervention of the highest representative of the central authorities

# 3.3.3 Repertoire of contention: aftermath

8. The highest representative of the central authorities
    + establishes maximum prices;
    + convenes an investigative committee;
    + reprimands merchands for artificial price hikes;
    + confiscates grain.
9. No reports on falling grain prices.

# 4. Summary

- Contrary to common arguments and presumptions, we find a long "tradition" of popular contentions in general and food "riots" in particular as well as female agency in genuinely political struggles in public places / space.
- There is no direct causal relation between food riots and food prices.
- Food riots are a relatively stable "repertoire of contention".
- Food riots are a *tactic* choice on behalf of the protestors and an inherently political act. They are part of the negotiations over political legitimacy *within* the existing political order as based in *just rule*, *safety of life*
