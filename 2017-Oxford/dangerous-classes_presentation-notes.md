### abstract

Almost thirty years ago Edmund Burke III made three claims in his attempt to apply C. Tilly's "repertoire of contenion" historical Middle Eastern societies: invariably contentions started at the chief mosque of a city, the crowds attacked foodstores, and food riots disappeared with the 19th century.[^1] Retaining Tilly's analytical framework, this paper proves all three claims wrong by presenting a first analysis of a growing sample of currently 14 food riots in Aleppo, Beirut, Damascus, Hama, and Homs at the end of Ottoman rule between 1878 and 1918. 

During these food riots, large groups of poor men and women gathered at central squares and in front of the authorities in demand for *equitable distribution* and *fair access* to *available bread*. Starting with an observable absence of direct causal relations between food prices and food riots and only rare instances of looting, which did not commonly target foodstores, I argue that food riots were neither particularly riotous nor predominantly concerned with food. Instead, the demand for *bread* had a symbolic value and was part of a relatively stable "repertoire of contention" that protestors could resort to in negotations over political legitimacy *within* the existing political order as based in the provision *just rule* and the *safety of life*.

Start with a *single* anecdote which shows the main changes must have been taken place in the nature of public space

### 1910, 11 Aug: Hama

On 11 August 1910, a demonstration of poor people in front of the Serail in Hama against the high prices of bread escalated into a full-fledged and violent bread riot. All available reports {>>in *al-Muqtabas* (Damascus), *al-Bashīr*, *al-Iqbāl*, *al-Ittiḥād al-ʿUthmānī*, *Lisān al-Ḥāl* (Beirut), and *Lisān al-Sharq* (Hama)<<} blame greedy wholesale merchants and their attempts to profit from the unrest in the Ḥawran and consequently high grain prices in Damascus by exporting all available cereals to the provincial capital.

On this Thursday gathered a large crowd of poor men, women, and children and marched to the Serail of the mutaṣarrif, Nāẓim Bey, where they peacefully demonstrated against the high profits from the trade of foodstuff and against all exports to Damascus. Nāẓim Bey convinced the crowd that the municipality should be the recipient of their anger and called upon the *baladiyya* to enforce sufficient measures of price control. Such measures were neither implemented nor announced due to the disagreement between mutaṣarrif and *baladiyya* concerning their respective responsibilities. {>>the mutaṣarrif and the baladiyya could not agree upon measures to pacify the protestors.<<} 

Dissatisfied by the official response, the crowds began to attack stores at three different locations: 

1.  In the city. When they did not manage to break into the store of al-Mashnūq, they resorted to pelting the house with stones. Then they turned onto Maḥmūd al-Farrā, whom they identified as the main culprit for their misery. They [finally] located al-Farrā at the slaughterhouse  and threatened him with murder. Yet, al-Farrā managed to lock himself inside and escaped. The crowds then split in two.
2.  Large quantities of grain destined for export to Damascus were stored at the railway station and the surrounding warehouses. The protestors forced the gates open and looted some 600 bags of grain without touching any of the railway carriages full of wheat waiting on a side track. This was due to the station master, a certain Nabīh Efendi, having convinced the crowd that the station with its stores of lentils and onions and all coaches were property of the state and that the Ḥijāz Railway as such was pious Muslim endeavour. He also managed to take a photo of the protestors with their loot that was later used for identification purposes. After the successful apprehension of grain, the crowds again targeted Maḥmūd al-Farrā and broke into one of his warehouses at the station that held skins and empty bags, which they looted.
3.  At the western square they looted the stores of Aḥmad al-Ṣamṣām and Ibn al-Habiyān  and of  al-Bārūdī and took all the rice, sugar, and coffee they could find. Finally, they looted the warehouse of Aswad and Sharrāḥ in the al-Jisr quarter and took all the grain stored inside.

The crowd,  continuously referred to as mob (*al-raʿāʿ*) by *al-Muqtabas*, could roam the street for two and a half hours without any intervention of the authorities and were finally dispersed by motorised imperial troops (15 men only). *Al-Muqtabas* mentions the honourable but futile attempt of a single mounted policeman, Khudr Efendi, to disperse the crowd: He got a severe beating and narrowly escaped with bruises and bleeding. The newspaper also polemically mocks the commander of the gendarmerie as having said "Darling, what can we do?" (*canım ne yapalım*) upon his arrival on the scene, after which he retreated with his men.[^11] Altogether, it was estimated the rioters looted goods with a value of between £T 1500[^12] and £T 2000.[^13]

In the aftermath of these events (called *ḥādithat Ḥamā*[^14] and *fitna*)[^15], the authorities set up an investigating committee to establish the reasons for the price hikes and to identify the looters. Both the mutaṣarrif and the vali of Syria issued orders against inflated prices and banning exports from Syria. But while the press riled for punishment of all monopolists, reports on falling prices are nowhere to be found.

## 1.3 First observations (1 min)

+ people did not loot (immediately)
+ people did address the authorities in a mostly peaceful manner
+ people gathered in central locations
+ women were a substantial part of the crowds.


# 2. Question and methodology (3 min)
## 2.1 Research questions (2 min)

1. what is the **function** of food riots---immediate remedy for hunger, lower and stable bread prices in the long term, political change? 
    + if they purpose is not the immediate satisfaction of a primal need?
    + why did they not immediately loot / forcefully appropriate foodstuffs?
2. what are the **implications** of food riots for the study of Middle Eastern societies?
    + Islamicate nature of protests?
    + gender relations?
    + assumed public/private divide?
    + where are the notables?


## 2.2 Methodology

- Capture and analysis of economic data on food prices
    + problem: absence of studies, apart from Donald Quataert
- Detailed case studies on individual food riots
- Systematic analysis of all food riots as part of a "repertoire of contention"
    + the specificities of individual locations and points in time are largely discarded without knowing them in full detail

# 3. First results and argument (4 min)
## 3.1 Empirical results

Sample of 14 food riots between 1875 and 1920 in Aleppo, Beirut, Damascus, Hama, Homs and Jaffa ([Map](../assets/food-riots/Map-FoodRiots.html), [table](../assets/food-riots/Table-FoodRiots.html))

1. There is no direct causal relation between food riots and food prices ([graph](../assets/food-riots/timeplotGrainPricesDamascus.html))
    + food riots and food prices are only loosely related
2. Food riots are a relatively stable "repertoire of contention" and take the form of a demonstration

## 3.2 argument
### argument: function and "nature" of food riots? 

1. There is no direct causal link between food prices and food riots
2. Food riots are a *tactic* choice on behalf of the protestors and an *inherently political* act. The are NOT an spontaneous erruption of popular anger.
    + food riots do not aim at immediately lowering food prices
    + as they have no impact on food prices they function as a "reminder" to the ruling classes concerning their obligations to the ruled
    + e.g. "food riots" occur in Beirut in October 1914 before any acts of war could have a real impact on people's lives  
3. Food riots are part of a relatively stable "repertoire of contention" (C. Tilly) and a symbolic repertoire
    + Following Charles Tilly's work, I define *food riots* as contentious collective action: a group of people assemble in a public place and raise the demand of lower food prices vis-à-vis another group of people. All case studies in this research project <!-- must --> conform to this basic definition of a specific *form* of action as well as a specific contentious *claim*. Based on empirical case studies I argue that such food riots form a *repertoire of contention* or "a limited set of routines that are learned, shared, and acted out through a relatively deliberate process of choice".
    + From this definition follows that food *riots* were neither particularly nor even necessarily riotous or violent.
4. The target of this conscious political *tactic* are the ruling authorities; protestors call for *equitable distribution* and *fair access* to *available bread*.
    + E.P. Thompson: moral economy
    + Amartya Sen: entitlement gap. Sen argues that famines are a function of  entitlement relationships
    + Eric Hobsbawm: people don't protest if they are too weak 
5. Food riots are thus part of the negotiations over political legitimacy *within* the existing political order as based in *just rule*, *safety of life*, etc. The demands are conservative and principally recognised as legitimate
    + they are genuinely conservative: return to just rule / governance
    + they make tactic choices bases on a repertoire of contention (and thus they are dependent on strategic choices of the more powerful strata)

### argument: importance of food riots / why study food riots?

The study of food riots provides insights into the development of

- legitimacy of political rule beyond elitist discourses found
- gender relations
    + women gather and protest outside their domicile and in the company of male strangers
    + contemporaneous sources, both local and consular, do not consider their participation exceptional
    + this is similar to early modern Europe (Thompson: "an awful lot" of women participating in food riots)
- notions of *public*

### notes

- als *inherent politische Handlungsweisen*, gewährt die Untersuchung von Nahrungsmittelunruhen einen Einblick in die Legitimität politischer Herrschaft und ihren Wandel über breite Gesellschaftschichten hinweg.

- Nahrungsmittelunruhen sind außergewöhnliche Ereignisse, die häufig genug auftreten um Einblick in die Lebenswelten und -vorstellungen "gewöhnlicher" Menschen gewähren, die häufig außerhalb unserer Quellen liege

- Mit der zunehmenden Etablierung einer Marktwirtschaft und institutionalisierter politischer Teilhabe (formal politics) verschwinden Brotunruhen aus dem "repertoire of contentions" (Tilly) in England und Frankreich im späten 18. und frühen 19. Jahrhundert (Louise and Charles Tilly, Thompson).
    - mit der Beschränkung von "formal politics" auf (besitzende) Männer und die Verdrängung (bürgerlicher) Frauen in die häusliche Sphäre, tauchen weibliche Nahrunsmittelunruhen im 20. Jhd. wieder auf. Nun aber als einzige mögliche Sphäre der Partizipation von auf "Einkaufen" und "für die Familie Sorgen" beschränkten Frauen (Lynn Tailor; c.f. Khater "Godess of the house").    

# 4. The repertoire (5 min)

## 1 Repertoire of contention: prologue (weeks)

1. Period of *artificially* high prices
    + there seems to be a rather stable threshold to the "just" price
        * As numerous scholars have observed, direct control of prices or even price fixing is highly contentious within Islamic legal discourses and the practices of Muslim rulers. The concept of *ḥisba*, when it comes to *just* prices, focusses on enabling and protecting just relations of exchange so that sellers and buyers will be able to negotiate in a fair manner and thus arrive at a fair solution. In this system bread prices are closely tied to grain prices, which can vary widely.
        * But the picture becomes more complex when one considers the numerous attempts by municipal councils at setting maximum prices for bread. On the one hand authorities argued falling grain prices should result in an equally falling price for bread. On the other hand, however, the price considered *fair* or *just* remained extremely stable at below Ps 3 for a *raṭl* of dark bread despite the fluctuation in grain prices.
    + blamed on greedy wholesale merchants seeking undue profits from either exporting or hoarding (*iḥtikār*) cereals
        * hoarding is not legally prohibited
2. Advantageous moment: tactic decision to increase the potential embarassment for the authorities
    + on Fridays
    + in close temporal vicinity to important holidays / festivities with their mandatory affirmative public rituals: *ʿīd al-fitr*, *mawlid nabawī* anniversary of the Sultan's accession to the throne, anniversary of the Young Turk Revolution
    + administrative changes: new Valis, absence of important officials, disbanded *baladiyyas*
    + absence of troops

## 2 Repertoire of contention: the food "riot" (few hours, a day)

A common term for reporting food riots is the generic "incident" (*ḥāditha*). When food riots turned violent, witnesses referred to a battle *maʿraka* (battle), such as 1910 in Aleppo, or even *thawra* (rebellion, revolt) and *fitna* (strife), as in Hama and Homs the same year. Yet, *Lisān al-Ḥāl* acknowledged that the foot riot in Homs was "a rebellion of empty stomachs" (*thawrat al-buṭūn al-fāghira*).


3. A crowd (*jumūʿ*, *jumhūr*, *khalq kathīr*) of poor people---men, women and children---gathers (*ijtamaʿ*)
    + freedom of assembly is granted by the imperial decree (*ḫāṭṭ-i hümāyūn*) of 1. August 1908 restituting the constitution
    + regulated by a 1909 law: 
        * unarmed, 
        * need official approval 2 days before, 
        * only during daylight
        * not in open places and on public streets (*al-ṭuruq al-ʿāmma*)
        * no freedom of speech
        * accompanied by government officials
    + 1912 temporal law on assemblies (*tajammuʿ*)
    + crowd: derivatives of the roots *j-m-ʿ* and *j-m-h-r*
4. The crowd marches onto the seat of the local government and peacefully raises its demand for affordable bread and grain
    + the people raise their discontent (*shakā*)
5. The crowd is violently dispersed / a combination of promises and threats leads the crowd to dissolve. Original failure of the authorities leads to further escalation.
    + the press publishes loathing critiques of incompetent and unwilling officials
6. (optional) The crowds turn on merchants and loot (*nahaba*) warehouses, stores, and railway stations
    + primarly looting goods other than foodstuffs
    + generally considered illegitimate by the sources: 
    + property is protected by law
    + theft, including of grain, is prohibited
    + the crowds are deligitimised as: *thāʾirūn* or *thuwwār* (rebels), *al-raʿāʿ* (mob) and *al-ghawghāʾ* (mob).
7. Successful intervention of the highest representative of the central authorities with the help of imperial troops
    + dispersing looters (often coming to late)
    + Peace and tranquility as the defining basis of Ottoman political legitimacy---*asāyiş-i ʿumūmī* or *al-rāḥa al-ʿumūmiyya*---are finally reestablished

## 3 Repertoire of contention: aftermath (weeks and months)

8. Intervention from the highest representative of the central authorities
    + establishes maximum prices;
    + convenes an investigative committee;
    + reprimands merchands for artificial price hikes;
    + confiscates grain;
    + has looters apprehended
9. No reports on falling grain prices.
<!-- 10. Eventual prosecution of looters -->


# 5. Conclusion
## 5.1 Conclusion: summary (1 min)

- Contrary to common arguments and presumptions, we find a long "tradition" of popular contentions in general and food "riots" in particular as well as female agency in genuinely political struggles in public places / space.
- There is no direct causal relation between food riots and food prices.
- Food riots are a relatively stable "repertoire of contention".
- Food riots are a *tactic* choice on behalf of the protestors and an inherently political act. They are part of the negotiations over political legitimacy *within* the existing political order as based in *just rule*, *safety of life*

## 5.2 Conclusion: open questions

- social background of protestors?
    + unknown beyond the label "poor"
    + *Dangerous classes* and *Lumpenproletariat* both refer to the urban poor in their quality as neither propertied nor engaged in any sort of production. (C.f. {Brace 1872;Bayat 2000})
    + *Lumpenproletariat* and *dangerous classes* in the Marxian tradition might fit my case studies on food riots as the protestors came from the lower classes of society. They did not display any class consciousness and were reactionary in so far as they called for the restoration of the old order and just rule.
    - As I have no information on the social composition of the protestors apart from generic references to them being poor and destitute, I would reject Brace's category of the *dangerous classes* as a meaningful analytical category.
- what are the **implications** of the repertoire?
    * Where are the notables? 
        - Hourani's *politics of notables* 
    * Where is the Islamic character of the contentions?
        - Edmond Burke III: portest invariably started at the chief mosque of a city
    * What are women doing in public places and voicing their anger in a public manner?
        - discussion on private/public: beyond the scope of the paper/presentation
        - this is certainly wrong: it was only in the twentieth century, argued Thompson, and solely elite families that left the domestic space of the internal courtyard and moved the private, such as picnics, into the public.[^2]
        - requires a comparison with other forms of social action

### notes
    
3. questions aiming at establishing whether food riots show exceptional / deviant behaviour: what is the **context** of these events?
    * Is the street a public space---physically and socially accessible to all?
        - what are the topographical conditions?
    * Are people allowed / used to gather in a specific manner?
        - what is the legal framework?
        - what are the symbolic repertoires for public gatherings?
    * To which extent do the crowds make tactic choices in regards to timing and location?
    * beyond the scope of the paper/presentation
