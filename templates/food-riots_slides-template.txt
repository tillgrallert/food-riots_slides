## 1.3 First observations

+ shared belief in a paternalist economic model
- there is no or at least no immediate looting
- crowds address the political authorities, predominantly peacefully
- crowds gather at central places, i.e. on the streets and in front of the seat of the political authorities
- women are a (substantial) part of the protests
- failure to achieve to stated objective

# 2. Question and methodology
## 2.1 Research question

1. What is the **function** of food riots<!-- ---immediate remedy for hunger, lower and stable bread prices in the long term, political change? -->
2. What are the **implications** of food riots for the study of Middle Eastern societies?

<!-- ## 1.3 Research questions

- Primary questions:
    - What is the function/purpose of food riots---lower bread prices, political change?
    - What is the relevance of food riots for our established "knowledge" of urban societies in the Eastern Mediterranean?
- Secondary questions:
    - Are food riots (part of) a "repertoire of contention?
    - What are the components (participants, demands, locations, occasions) of this repertoire and how do they change?
    - What is the relation between food prices and food riots?
    - Why do we encounter geographic clustering? -->

## 2.2 Methodology

- Capture and analysis of economic data on food prices
- Detailed case studies on individual food riots
- Systematic analysis of all food riots as part of a "repertoire of contention"

## 2.3 Sources

<!-- comment on the biasses and strengths of these sources -->
- Local newspapers and periodicals
- Consular reports
- Ottoman archival documents
- First person accounts

## 2.3 Sources: newspapers

- state of collections
- mode of production

![*al-Muqtabas* #1813, 1 Feb 1916: reporting a "food riot" in Damascus?](../assets/muqtabas-1813.jpg)

</div>

<!-- translation -->
<!-- - the municipality announced that the reason for the long cues in front of the ovens and bakeries and the alarm among the populace is the lining up of those who had kept their wheat in their homes. People and the poor then began to crowd together in the hope to buy bread and the plenty of wheat became known to the public (al-ʿumūm).
- the municipality and the police do nothing [against] those who dare to harass the people and the poor in this manner
- and it remains to those who have hoarded wheat to use and eat it and not further keep it and the stores of those who do not do so should be ceased and shared with the poor -->

<!-- - yesterday, the baladiyya was crowded (*izduḥimat*) with poor women (*bi-l-faqīrāt min al-nisāʾ*).
- due to the generosity of Enver Pasha / Anwar Pasha money was distributed among them -->


## 2.4 Sample

- c.600 price observations for cereals and bread
- c.400 qualitative statements on food prices
- 19 food riots between 1875 and 1920 in Aleppo, Beirut, Damascus, Hama, Homs, Jaffa, and Jerusalem

# 3. First results and argument
## 3.1 Empirical results

1. There is no direct relation between food riots and food prices
2. Food riots are a relatively stable "repertoire of contention" and take the form of a demonstration

## 3.1 Food prices and food riots

<!-- wheat prices -->

## 3.1 Food prices and food riots: annual cycle

<!-- wheat prices annual cycle -->
![](../assets/rplot_prices-wheat-1874-1916_annual-cycle-box.png)


## 3.2 <!-- Hypotheses --> argument

1. There is no direct causal relation between food prices and food riots
2. Food riots are a **tactic** choice on behalf of the protestors and an **inherently political** act 
3. Food riots are part of a relatively stable "repertoire of contention" (C. Tilly) and a symbolic repertoire
4. The main target of this conscious political **tactic** are the ruling authorities; protestors call for **equitable distribution** and **fair access** to **available bread**.
5. Food riots are thus part of the negotiations over political legitimacy **within** the existing political order as based in **just rule**, **safety of life**, etc. The demands are conservative and principally recognised as legitimate

## 4.1 Prologue (weeks)

1. Period of **artificially** high prices
2. Advantageous moment

<!-- add plots again? -->

## 4.2 the food "riot" (few hours, a day)

3. A crowd of poor people---men, women and children---gathers
4. The crowd marches onto the seat of the local government and peacefully raises its demand for affordable bread and grain
5. The crowd is violently dispersed / a combination of promises and threats leads the crowd to dissolve. Original failure of the authorities leads to further escalation.
6. (optional) The crowds turn on merchants and loot warehouses, stores, and railway stations
7. Successful intervention of the highest representative of the central authorities with the help of imperial troops

## 4.3 Aftermath (weeks and months)

8. Intervention from the highest representative of the central authorities
9. No reports on falling grain prices.
<!-- 10. Eventual prosecution of looters -->

# What are the implications of this repertoire?
## The politics of notables?

- Generally strong argument for a persistence of the three-tiered Ottoman *ancien régime* well into the 20th century

<div class="c_width-30">
(transregional) imperial bureaucracy
</div>
<div class="c_width-30">
(local) notables
</div>
<div class="c_width-30">
the populace
</div>

- But where are the notables?



## What about the Islamic character of contentions?

- All contention invariably starts at the Friday mosques (Burke)

## What about the public/private divide and gender segregation? 

- the "Islamic City" paradigm is frequently invoked ouside the circles of specialists

## novelty of demonstrations?

- Gelvin, Thompson et al.

# 6. Conclusion

## Conclusion

- Contrary to common arguments and presumptions, we find a long "tradition" of popular contentions in general and food "riots" in particular as well as female agency in genuinely political struggles in public places / space.
- There is no direct causal relation between food prices and food riots.
- Food riots form a relatively stable "repertoire of contention".
- Food riots are a **tactic** choice on behalf of the protestors and an inherently political act. They are part of the negotiations over political legitimacy **within** the existing political order as based in **just rule**, **safety of life**
